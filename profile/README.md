## 🌿 Branching Strategy (for Contributors)

We use **Git Flow** to manage our project’s development:

- **`main`**: The production-ready branch that represents the live version of the website and code.
- **`develop`**: This is the main development branch, where features and fixes are integrated.
- **`feature/*`**: Individual feature branches created from `develop` for specific tasks.

### Example Workflow:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/africa-computer-society/africa-computer-society.git

# Checkout the develop branch
git checkout develop

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-page

# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new page content"

# Push the branch
git push origin feature/new-page

# Open a pull request to merge into develop
